  Using IMARIS to visualize embryo development of Zebra fish
abstract: |
  The Barresi Lab at Smith College has recently acquired a light-sheet microscope that will be utilized to study bio-electric patterns in embryonic development of Zebrafish. The advanced light-sheet microscope captures 3D images of the embryos which can be analyzed through IMARIS, a new software being implemented in the lab. In the beginning of our project, we completed multiple online tutorials to understand IMARIS and the way it visualizes and analyzes given data. Once the software was set up in the Barresi Lab, we visited the Work Station multiple times to familiarize ourselves with working with IMARIS. In order to translate the 3D images into data interpretable to biologists, we will develop a data pipeline. To do so we will write plugins for IMARIS which will automate fluorescence, intensity, and volume calculations. This process will be completed using Python and Fiji ImageJ. These plugins will ultimately streamline the analysis process of incoming data from the light-sheet microscope.

# Introduction
We are working with Professor Barresi's lab to achieve the following goals: 1) Use IMARIS to find evidence that supports the goals of the lab 2) Document protocols for going from data aggregation to data utilization 3) Create a plugin for IMARIS to automate data analyses on 3D and 4D images. Questions the lab is interested in include: a) Are bioelectric signals are important in creating the early brain? b) Does the migratorial cell population (crimneou) lay the groundwork for the neurons to form the formation of our face? c) How do embryonic brains form for Zebra Fishes? IMARIS is an Interactive Microscopy Image Analysis software offered by Bitplane that allows users to process and analyze fluorescent 3D and 4D microscopy images [@GAUTIER2021109038]. Although previously the lab had other software that allowed for 3D visualizations, it didn't have as high of a resolution as IMARIS, therefore the lab had decided to switch software. However, they are not as familiar with this software, and thus need well documented protocols to help guide their usage. Currently, analysis of data requires users to manually create reference points and surfaces across the image to gather information. Such a process can be lengthy and difficult, and the comparisons can be messy due to the different orientations the data may come in. As such, plugins via Fiji ImageJ are needed to automate the analysis and orientation process.  The full work will be available on GitHub\footnote{\texttt{GitHub Repository}: \url{https://github.com/sds-capstone/barresi}.}

# Data
Data employed in this project is in the form of z-stack imaging, which is a compilation of photographs taken at interval planes of various focuses of a single pollen grain. Each clip of the photographs serves as an image in the specific file types which are compatible with IMARIS software. Together, these photographs then are combined into a video, which is stored in the *Pollen Database* for the users to explore by freezing at any clips of the video. Accordingly, morphological characteristics of the pollen for the species also are included in the database. The general purpose of maintaining this database is to generate a detailed document recording the process of data aggregation to data utilization [@NIKONSMICROSCOPY]. The source of data for this study is the light-sheet microscopy system established in Professor Barresi's lab. More specifically, the microscopy system takes photographs of the developmental stages Zebra Fishes' embryo. 

In this study, the dependent variables are development time for each embryonic stage, intensity of dyed embryos stratified by the factor of age, and spatial position of embryos. The independent variables are the strength of the trans-genes, tools needed in order to produce the florescence. What's more, the units of observation in this study is the number of embryos collected in a batch, which composes the number of fertilized eggs a female Zebra fish produced in a hatch. 

Some of the limitations of this research is the speed of the light-sheet microscopy we utilized, since the system takes 10 seconds taking photograph of a single Z-stack imaging. Additionally, another major constraint will be its capacity in taking a given number of embryos in a given time frame. For now, the capacity and the speed of the light-sheet microscopy system allows a production of 240 samples for a week if collecting a single batch a week. Mistakes in the process of data collection also can pose damage to the embryo samples. 

Files of zebra fish embryo slices then directly be pipeline into the IMARIS Software to create videos from 1 dimensional to 4 dimensional data files, which serves as records for each developmental trajectory.  



#Methods

Based on results generated from previous studies using confocal microscopy images as data for analysis purposes, even a single software package from a workable analytical program can be used for data procession [@ZINCHUK2009125]. Although there exist a number of multidimensional analytical programs which allows for accurate quantification via high quality visualization, like BioImageXD and Icy, Imaris is the most suitable platform to use in that it has quality image resolution and built-in algorithms to generate workable plug-ins and fundamental descriptive statistics directly in an excel document format. 
During the early planning stages of this study, whether to employ ImageJ or Imaris as the major analytical program constitutes an imperative step. Since the nature of the study is to eventually generate a workable plug-in to assist in fulfilling the research goals of the Barresi lab, the computable feasibility is the most essential feature to focus on when choosing an analytical program to work with. Although both ImageJ and Imaris can generate Multi-channel, colored images, ImageJ has functions in the form of individual commands allowing customization while Imaris has pre-programmed image analysis tools organized within a clearly guided interface. One significant advantage of Imaris is its feature of allowing the user to rotate the z-stack along both the x and y-axis with 360 degrees rotation. Moreover, the utilization of 3D reconstructions in Imaris assists in visualizing sophisticated biological structures, in the case of this study, the Zebrafish brain. With the capability of generating reproducible quantitative procedures embedded in Imaris for analyzing immunofluorescence labeled embryos [@miura-hal-02910986], the study is able to capture more complete assessment of the neural connections between small structures of the brain, for instance, the communication activities between the two hemispheres. 

We decided to use python to create our plugin as, out of the languages available for firect interaction with the Imaris software function, python was the most familiar in the team. To create the plugin, we linked Visual Studios onto Imaris by adding the Imaris path and PYTHONPATH into the evironment We used GitHub as the method to share and update our code. To interact with the Imaris API, we needed to place in `import ImarisLib.py` in the plugin file, Lastly, we grouped all the possible plugins into a folder and added the path to the folder into Imaris so that all the plugins in that folder are accesible.

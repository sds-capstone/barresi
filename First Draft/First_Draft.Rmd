# Abstract (Carol and Haley) 
The Barresi Lab at Smith College has recently acquired a light-sheet microscope that will be utilized to study bio-electric patterns in embryonic development of Zebrafish. The advanced light-sheet microscope captures 3D images of the embryos which can be analyzed through IMARIS, a new software being implemented in the lab. In order to translate the 3D images into data interpretable by biologists, we are developing a data pipeline. To do so we are writing plugins for IMARIS which will automate fluorescence, intensity, and volume calculations. This process will be done using Python and Fiji ImageJ. These plugins will ultimately streamline the analysis process of incoming data from the light sheet microscope. 

*Refer to line 45*

# Introduction(Catherine)
We are working with Professor Barresi's lab in trying to create a plugin for Imaris to automate data analyzations on 3D and 4D images. IMARIS is an Interactive Microscopy Image Analysis software offered by Bitplane that allows users to process and analyze flurescent 3D and 4D microscopy images [@GAUTIER2021109038]. Currently, analysis of data require users to manually create reference points and surfaces across the image to gather information. However, such a process can be lengthy and difficult, especially for people who are new to IMARIS, and can be more difficult to replicate in research studies. As such, a plugin that automates the data processing is needed.


# Data(Summer)
The data is currently being gathered from the light sheet microscope of Professor Barresi's lab, and will consist of .tif files of Zebrafish embryo slices directly pipelined into the IMARIS Software to create a 3D picture. As the data collection has only just begun, we do not have a lot of data at our disposal. However, from the case studies IMARIS provides, we are able to better understand how to navigate the data once we do attain them.

#Methods (not ours)
Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

# Results

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

Bulleted lists look like this:

* First bullet

* Third bullet

Numbered lists can be added as follows:

1. First item
2. Second item

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc.

(\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.}

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
<!-- If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. -->

<!-- Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows: -->
Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.

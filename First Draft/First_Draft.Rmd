  Using IMARIS to visualize embryo development of Zebra fish
abstract: |
  The Barresi Lab at Smith College has recently acquired a light-sheet microscope that will be utilized to study bio-electric patterns in embryonic development of Zebrafish. The advanced light-sheet microscope captures 3D images of the embryos which can be analyzed through IMARIS, a new software being implemented in the lab. In the beginning of our project, we completed multiple online tutorials to understand IMARIS and the way it visualizes and analyzes given data. Once the software was set up in the Barresi Lab, we visited the Work Station multiple times to familiarize ourselves with working with IMARIS. In order to translate the 3D images into data interpretable to biologists, we will develop a data pipeline. To do so we will write plugins for IMARIS which will automate fluorescence, intensity, and volume calculations. This process will be completed using Python and Fiji ImageJ. These plugins will ultimately streamline the analysis process of incoming data from the light-sheet microscope.

# Introduction
We are working with Professor Barresi's lab to achieve the following goals: 1) Use IMARIS to find evidence that supports the goals of the lab 2) Document protocols for going from data aggregation to data utilization 3) Create a plugin for IMARIS to automate data analyses on 3D and 4D images. Questions the lab is interested in include: a) Are bioelectric signals are important in creating the early brain? b) Does the migratorial cell population (crimneou) lay the groundwork for the neurons to form the formation of our face? c) How do embryonic brains form for Zebra Fishes? IMARIS is an Interactive Microscopy Image Analysis software offered by Bitplane that allows users to process and analyze fluorescent 3D and 4D microscopy images [@GAUTIER2021109038]. Although previously the lab had other software that allowed for 3D visualizations, it didn't have as high of a resolution as IMARIS, therefore the lab had decided to switch software. However, they are not as familiar with this software, and thus need well documented protocols to help guide their usage. Currently, analysis of data requires users to manually create reference points and surfaces across the image to gather information. Such a process can be lengthy and difficult, and the comparisons can be messy due to the different orientations the data may come in. As such, plugins via Fiji ImageJ are needed to automate the analysis and orientation process. 

# Data
The data is currently being gathered from the light-sheet microscope from Professor Barresi's lab, and will consist of .tif files of Zebrafish embryo slices directly pipelined into the IMARIS Software to create a 3D picture. As the data collection has only just begun, we do not have a lot of data at our disposal. However, from the case studies IMARIS provides, we are able to better understand how to navigate the data once we do attain them.
